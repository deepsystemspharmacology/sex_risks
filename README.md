# Drugs with Sex-Linked Risks of ADRs

###Version 1.0

This research investigation identified drugs associated with disproportionately worse ADRs in either sex (male or female). A standardized version of the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System was used in conjuction with crowdsourced rankings of ADR severity to calculate sex-specific drug risks based on ADR severity and frequency. The research is detailed in an initial paper entitled, "Drugs with Sex-Linked Risk of ADRs". The Supplementary Materials provide all the relevant data tables and figures. Additionally, our results can be reproduced using code from the Jupyter Notebook.
