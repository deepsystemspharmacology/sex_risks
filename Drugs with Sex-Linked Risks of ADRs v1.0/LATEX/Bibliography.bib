	abstract = {Background
MetaGeM is a wide gender-medicine project comprising post hoc and meta-analyses by gender of clinical outcomes, therapeutic approaches, and safety data from previously conducted observational studies to explore possible gender differences in real-life clinical settings. We report the results of the safety meta-analysis of seven MetaGeM studies, evaluating gender differences in adverse event (AE) incidence and severity.

Methods
Data were collected between February 2002 and July 2013. Male and female patients were compared for the main safety variables, using Student’s t-test, χ2 test, or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. As supportive analysis, a logistic regression model was estimated to evaluate associations between gender and outcome.

Results
In total, 4,870 patients (46\% females, 54\% males) were included in the analysis; age was higher for females (mean ± standard deviation 61.2±18.3 years) than males (56.3±16.6 years). Overall, 264 AEs were reported (59.1\% in males). There were no significant gender differences in the percentage of patients with at least one AE: 3.0\% for females versus 3.9\% for males, χ2 test P{\textgreater}0.05. According to the logistic regression model results, no association between gender and AEs occurrence seems to exist. A statistically significant gender difference in the percentage of drug-related AEs emerged (37.6\% in females vs 20.8\% in males, χ2
P=0.0039). Slightly significantly more AEs in females were addressed with treatment compared with males (78.1\% vs 66.7\%, χ2
P=0.0485). Total serious AEs (SAEs) were 47 (72\% in males). The frequency of patients with ≥1 SAE was 0.6\% in females versus 1.2\% in males (χ2 test P=0.0246).

Conclusion
This safety analysis on a large sample of almost 5,000 patients with different diseases and treated with a wide range of different drugs provides a useful overview on possible gender differences in drug tolerability, which may be helpful in more accurately designing future clinical trials from a gender-specific perspective.},

Such a resource would be useful for several applications, including assessment of the risks and benefits of drugs and improvement of patient-centered care. It could also be used to triage predictions of drug adverse events.
Objective: The intent of the study was to rank ADRs according to severity.
Methods: We used Internet-based crowdsourcing to rank ADRs according to severity. We assigned 126,512 pairwise comparisons of ADRs to 2589 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers and used these comparisons to rank order 2929 ADRs.
Results: There is good correlation (rho=.53) between the mortality rates associated with ADRs and their rank. Our ranking highlights severe drug-ADR predictions, such as cardiovascular ADRs for raloxifene and celecoxib. It also triages genes associated with severe ADRs such as epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR), associated with glioblastoma multiforme, and SCN1A, associated with epilepsy.
Conclusions: ADR ranking lays a first stepping stone in personalized drug risk assessment. Ranking of ADRs using crowdsourcing may have useful clinical and financial implications, and should be further investigated in the context of health care decision making.},

Pharmacokinetics in women is affected by lower body weight, slower gastrointestinal motility, less intestinal enzymatic activity, and slower glomerular filtration rate. Because of delayed gastric emptying, women may need to extend the interval between eating and taking medications that must be absorbed on an empty stomach. Other physiologic differences may affect medication dosages. For example, because renal clearance is slower in women, some renally-excreted medications, such as digoxin, may require a dosage adjustment. Pharmacodynamic differences in women include greater sensitivity to and enhanced effectiveness of beta blockers, opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and typical antipsychotics. Additionally, women are 50 to 75 percent more likely than men to experience an adverse drug reaction. Because women are prone to torsades de pointes, medications known to prolong the QT interval should be used with caution. Women should receive lower dosages of digoxin and have lower serum concentration targets than men because of higher mortality rates.},

	abstract = {AIMS
Cardiovascular disease in women is often underestimated. The effects of cardiovascular drugs differ between the sexes because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) within these drug classes may have serious consequences, leading to hospital admission. We aimed to study differences between men and women in hospital admissions for ADRs due to cardiovascular drugs.

METHODS
We conducted a nationwide study of all hospital admissions between 2000 and 2005 with data from the Dutch National Medical Register. Relative risks were calculated of hospital admissions due to ADRs to the different cardiovascular drug groups for women compared with men. By an ecological design, risks were adjusted for the total number of Dutch inhabitants and the total number of prescriptions.

RESULTS
In total, 14 207 of the hospital admissions (34\% of all ADR-related admissions) were attributed to cardiovascular drugs [7690 in women (54\%; 95\% confidence interval 53–55\%)]. ‘Anticoagulants and salicylates’ (n= 8988), ‘high- and low-ceiling diuretics’ (n= 2242) and ‘cardiotonic glycosides’ (n= 932) were responsible for the majority of the ADR-related hospital admissions. The most pronounced sex differences were seen in users of low-ceiling diuretics (relative risk 4.02; 95\% confidence interval 3.12–5.19), cardiotonic glycosides (relative risk 2.38; 95\% confidence interval 2.06–2.74), high-ceiling diuretics (relative risk 2.10; 95\% confidence interval 1.91–2.32) and coronary vasodilators (relative risk 0.77; 95\% confidence interval 0.65–0.91).

CONCLUSIONS
Clear sex differences exist in ADRs requiring hospital admission for different cardiovascular drug groups. Sex differences should be taken into account in the prescription and evaluation of drugs.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate drug interactions and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the older patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) and to characterize risk factors.Methods: In 80 patients aged 65 years and older medication history and ED drug administration were analysed. Medical records were analysed for ADRs by an expert panel which also evaluated their avoidability and causality. An interaction program was used to search for potential drug interactions followed by assessment for clinical significance. Data were analysed using a logistic regression model. The significance level was set at α = 0.05.Results: Eighty seven ADRs were identified in 37 patients; 18 were the result of an interaction (15 patients). Causality was assessed as definite (n = 1), probable (n = 62) and possible (n = 24). The reason for admission was definitely and probably related to an ADR in 6 and 18 patients respectively. Only 17 (20\%) of the ADRs were assessed as unavoidable, while 23 (26\%) and 47 (54\%) were classified as definitely and possibly avoidable, respectively. ADRs were related with female gender (p = 0.023) and number of drugs (p = 0.004), but not with high age (p = 0.151). Clinically relevant interactions were related with older age (p = 0.032) and number of drugs (p = 0.003), but not with gender (p = 0.380).None of the interactions with ED initiated medications were considered unjustified.Conclusions: ADRs frequently occur in the older patients admitted to the ED and are an important cause of hospital admissions with a substantial contribution of adverse drug interactions.},

Objectives: This article updates previously published literature describing sex differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antidepressants, and examines specific issues that face women with psychiatric illness.
Methods: An English-language literature search was performed with the PubMed database (March 2003–December 2008) using combinations of the search terms sex, gender, and antidepressants. In addition, each antidepressant was identified in the 63rd edition of the Physicians’ Desk Reference.
Results: The current data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of antidepressants can be substantially different between women and men. Likewise, the response to antidepressants can be quite variable, including sex differences in adverse effects and time to response.
Conclusions: Despite the many sex differences reported, there is still little published work systematically evaluating potential sex differences in antidepressant pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. More research is needed to guide the treatment of depression and other mental illnesses. (Gend Med. 2009;6:522–543) © 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.},

	abstract = {The entire drug safety enterprise has a need to search, retrieve, evaluate, and synthesize scientific evidence more efficiently. This discovery and synthesis process would be greatly accelerated through access to a common framework that brings all relevant information sources together within a standardized structure. This presents an opportunity to establish an open-source community effort to develop a global knowledge base, one that brings together and standardizes all available information for all drugs and all health outcomes of interest (HOIs) from all electronic sources pertinent to drug safety. To make this vision a reality, we have established a workgroup within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, http://ohdsi.org) collaborative. The workgroup’s mission is to develop an open-source standardized knowledge base for the effects of medical products and an efficient procedure for maintaining and expanding it. The knowledge base will make it simpler for practitioners to access, retrieve, and synthesize evidence so that they can reach a rigorous and accurate assessment of causal relationships between a given drug and HOI. Development of the knowledge base will proceed with the measureable goal of supporting an efficient and thorough evidence-based assessment of the effects of 1,000 active ingredients across 100 HOIs. This non-trivial task will result in a high-quality and generally applicable drug safety knowledge base. It will also yield a reference standard of drug–HOI pairs that will enable more advanced methodological research that empirically evaluates the performance of drug safety analysis methods.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}When a study outcome is rare in all strata used for an analysis, the odds ratio estimate of causal effects will approximate the risk ratio; therefore, odds ratios from most case-control studies can be interpreted as risk ratios. However, if a study outcome is common, the odds ratio will be further from 1 than the risk ratio. There is debate regarding the merits of risk ratios compared with odds ratios for the analysis of trials and cohort and cross-sectional studies with common outcomes. Odds ratios are conveniently symmetrical with regard to the outcome definition; the odds ratio for outcome\textit{Y}is the inverse of the odds ratio for the outcome not\textit{Y}. Risk ratios lack this symmetry, so it may be necessary to present 1 risk ratio for outcome\textit{Y}and another for outcome not\textit{Y}. Risk ratios, but not odds ratios, have a mathematical property called collapsibility; this means that the size of the risk ratio will not change if adjustment is made for a variable that is not a confounder. Because of collapsibility, the risk ratio, assuming no confounding, has a useful interpretation as the ratio change in average risk due to exposure among the exposed. Because odds ratios are not collapsible, they usually lack any interpretation either as the change in average odds or the average change in odds (the average odds ratio).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Gender medicine and pharmacology have an important role in the development of an personalized therapy on every single patient. In particular, gender medicine could predict the difference response to a pharmacologic therapy on the basis of patient's sex. Pharmacovigilance could help in this process through a continuous monitoring of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) ensuring a safer drug therapy. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate ADRs in the general populations on the basis of gender during a 6-month period of observation in order to draw attention to eventual risk factors. During the observation period were collected 405 ADRs: women represented 54,57\% overall and 56,23\% considered only the ADRs in adult population ({\textgreater}17ys) excluding intentional overdoses. Antibiotics were the most reported class of drug for suspected ADRs without significant gender difference. On the other hand female patients resulted most involved in suspected contrast media adverse reactions (77,27\%) and opioid analgesics adverse reactions (81,80\%). Female gender has been identified as a general risk factor for ADRs, especially due to contrast media and opioid analgesics. These data underline the importance of gender medicine and gender pharmacology to minimize safety problems and, at the same time, optimize the therapy efficacy. Moreover an increased inclusion of women in clinical trials could helps in the evaluation of drug safety for adverse events and drug toxicity.},

Partially due to the increased length of hospitalization, more drugs were used in long-term hospitals. The number of different drugs used to treat the same problem varied greatly. For some therapeutic indications, one particular drug was widely accepted by most hospitals; in others, there was a wide variance. More than one drug of the same pharmacological action was often prescribed for the same patient. Older patients and women received more drugs. Antibiotics were used in a high percentage of all hospital patients. There were many incomplete prescriptions and discrepancies between drug orders written by doctors and records of medications administered by nurses. These results indicate the need for an epidemiologic approach to therapeutics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public attention and recent US Congressional activity has intensified focus on escalating medication prices. However, the actual cost of medication use extends beyond the up-front cost of purchasing medicines. It also encompasses the additional medical costs of morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication regimens, including medication nonadherence.
OBJECTIVES: Applying the most current nationally representative data sources, our goal was to estimate the cost of prescription drug-related morbidity and mortality in the United States.
METHODS: Total costs of nonoptimized prescription drug use and average pathway costs for a patient who experienced a treatment failure (TF), a new medical problem (NMP), or a TF and NMP were modeled in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and TreeAge Pro Healthcare, v2014 (TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown, MA), respectively.
RESULTS: The estimated annual cost of prescription drug-related morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication therapy was \$528.4 billion in 2016 US dollars, with a plausible range of \$495.3 billion to \$672.7 billion. The average cost of an individual experiencing TF, NMP, or TF and NMP after initial prescription use were \$2481 (range: \$2233, \$2742), \$2610 (range: \$2374, \$2848) and \$2572 (range: \$2408, \$2751), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated annual cost of drug-related morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication therapy was \$528.4 billion, equivalent to 16\% of total US health care expenditures in 2016. We propose expansion of comprehensive medication management programs by clinical pharmacists in collaborative practices with physicians and other prescribers as an effective and scalable approach to mitigate these avoidable costs and improve patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background Numerous observational studies suggest that preventable adverse drug reactions are a significant burden in healthcare, but no meta-analysis using a standardised definition for adverse drug reactions exists. The aim of the study was to estimate the percentage of patients with preventable adverse drug reactions and the preventability of adverse drug reactions in adult outpatients and inpatients. Methods Studies were identified through searching Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, IPA, Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science in September 2010, and by hand searching the reference lists of identified papers. Original peer-reviewed research articles in English that defined adverse drug reactions according to WHO’s or similar definition and assessed preventability were included. Disease or treatment specific studies were excluded. Meta-analysis on the percentage of patients with preventable adverse drug reactions and the preventability of adverse drug reactions was conducted. Results Data were analysed from 16 original studies on outpatients with 48797 emergency visits or hospital admissions and from 8 studies involving 24128 inpatients. No studies in primary care were identified. Among adult outpatients, 2.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–3.2\%) had preventable adverse drug reactions and 52\% (95\% CI: 42–62\%) of adverse drug reactions were preventable. Among inpatients, 1.6\% (95\% CI: 0.1–51\%) had preventable adverse drug reactions and 45\% (95\% CI: 33–58\%) of adverse drug reactions were preventable. Conclusions This meta-analysis corroborates that preventable adverse drug reactions are a significant burden to healthcare among adult outpatients. Among both outpatients and inpatients, approximately half of adverse drug reactions are preventable, demonstrating that further evidence on prevention strategies is required. The percentage of patients with preventable adverse drug reactions among inpatients and in primary care is largely unknown and should be investigated in future research.},
